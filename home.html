        <h1>How COVID-19 affected our Country</h1>
        <p>
        - The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, 
          currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year. <br><br>
        - Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. <br><br>
        - The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. <br><br>
        - Millions of agricultural workers – waged and self-employed – while feeding the world, regularly face high levels of working poverty, malnutrition and poor health, and suffer from a lack of  safety and labour protection as well as other types of abuse. <br><br>
        - With low and irregular incomes and a lack of social support, many of them are spurred to continue working, often in unsafe conditions, thus exposing themselves and their families to additional risks. <br><br>
        - The pandemic has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk.<br><br>
        - The COVID-19 outbreak affects all segments of the population and is particularly detrimental to members of those social groups in the most vulnerable situations, continues to affect populations, including people living in poverty situations, older persons, persons with disabilities, youth, and indigenous people.<br><br>
        - Older persons are particularly susceptible to the risk of infection from COVID-19, especially those with chronic health conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.<br><br>
        - In terms of employment, youth are disproportionately unemployed, and those who are employed often work in the informal economy , on precarious contracts that are likely to be severely affected by COVID-19.<br><br>
